## Introduction to Steghide

Steghide is a command-line tool used for embedding and extracting data within image and audio files. It is commonly used in digital forensics and security contexts for steganography, the practice of concealing data within other non-suspicious files.

## Key Features

- **Support for Multiple File Formats:** Can work with a variety of file formats including JPEG, BMP, WAV, and AU.

- **Password Protection:** Embedded data can be encrypted with a passphrase, adding an extra layer of security.

- **Compression:** Provides the ability to compress the data before embedding it to save space and reduce the size of the cover file.

- **Extraction of Hidden Data:** Capable of extracting hidden data from cover files, supporting various steganographic techniques.

## Installation

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

```bash
sudo apt install steghide
```

## Basic Usage

### Embedding Data

To embed a file into an image, use the following command:

```bash
steghide embed -cf cover_image.jpg -ef secret_file.txt
```

- `-cf` specifies the cover file (e.g., an image).
- `-ef` specifies the file to be hidden.

### Extracting Data

To extract hidden data from a file:

```bash
steghide extract -sf cover_image.jpg
```

- `-sf` specifies the stego file (e.g., the image containing hidden data).

### Listing Embedded Files

To list files embedded in a cover file:

```bash
steghide info cover_image.jpg
```
