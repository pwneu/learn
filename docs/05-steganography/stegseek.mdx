## Introduction to Stegseek

Stegseek is a tool designed to automate the process of searching for hidden data within cover files, particularly in images. It is often used in conjunction with other steganography tools and techniques to identify files that may contain hidden information.

## Key Features

- **Automated Search:** Stegseek automates the search for hidden data within cover files, saving time and effort compared to manual methods.

- **Support for Various Formats:** Primarily works with common image formats, including JPEG and PNG.

- **Customizable Search Parameters:** Allows users to specify parameters and settings to tailor the search to specific requirements.

- **Integration with Other Tools:** Can be used alongside tools like Steghide to enhance steganographic analysis.

## Installation

Here's how you can install stegseek:

:::info
Pre-installed with Kali Linux.
:::

### Debian

```bash
sudo apt-get install stegseek
```

## Basic Usage

### Searching for Hidden Data

To search for hidden data within an image file:

```bash
stegseek -f cover_image.jpg
```

- `-f` specifies the cover file to be searched.

Stegseek will attempt to identify and extract any hidden data based on the parameters and settings.

### Customizing Search Parameters

To use specific parameters for the search:

stegseek -f cover_image.jpg -p parameter_file.txt

- `-p` specifies a file containing parameters for the search.
