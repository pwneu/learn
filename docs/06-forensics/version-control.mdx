Git is a distributed version control system, widely used for managing and tracking changes in software projects. It is not a cybersecurity tool in the traditional sense because it doesn’t directly protect systems, detect vulnerabilities, or respond to threats. Instead, Git is designed to help developers and teams manage their code and collaborate more effectively.

However, Git is incredibly valuable in the field of cybersecurity and digital forensics:

- **Version Control for Scripts and Tools:** Cybersecurity professionals often create scripts and tools to automate tasks or conduct analyses. Using Git allows them to track changes over time, revert to previous versions if needed, and collaborate with others without conflicts.

- **Tracking Configuration Changes:** In digital forensics, maintaining an accurate history of changes is crucial. Git helps you keep a detailed record of every modification, which is essential for ensuring the integrity of an investigation and for providing clear documentation in legal or audit scenarios.

- **Collaboration on Security Projects:** When working on cybersecurity projects, such as developing security tools or analyzing malware, Git enables teams to work together efficiently. It ensures that everyone has access to the latest files and can contribute without overwriting each other's work.

- **Audit Trails and Documentation:** In cybersecurity, having a clear audit trail is important for accountability and transparency. Git automatically records who made what changes and when, which can be invaluable in forensic investigations and incident response.

In summary, while Git is not a tool designed specifically for cybersecurity, it plays a crucial supporting role by enabling effective version control, collaboration, and documentation—key aspects of many cybersecurity and digital forensics tasks.

## Installing Git

Here are the commands to install Git on your system:

:::info
Pre-installed with Kali Linux.
:::

### Windows 11
```bash
winget install -e --id Git.Git
```

### Debian
```bash
sudo apt install git
```

## Git Basics
You can verify the installation using this command.
```bash
git --version
```

Here is how you can show the list of all commands.
```bash
git -h
```

### Cloning a Repository
Here is how you can clone a repository using Git.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pwneu/pwneu.git
```

### Git Branches
To see a list of all the branches in your repository, use:
```bash
git branch
```
This command shows you all the branches you have, and highlights the branch you're currently working on.

To change from one branch to another, use:
```bash
git checkout <branch_name>
```
Replace `<branch_name>` with the name of the branch you want to switch to. This command updates your working directory to match the selected branch.

### Showing Commit History
To see the history of changes made in the current branch, use the following command:
```bash
git log
```
This command lists all the commits, showing details like who made each change, when it was made, and a brief description of what was changed. It helps you track the evolution of the project over time.

You can use the following command to switch your working directory to the exact state of the repository at a specific commit:
```bash
git checkout <commit_hash>
```
This command puts you in a special mode where you're not on any branch. Instead, your files will look exactly as they did at that specific commit. In this mode, you can look at or test the old code, but any changes you make won’t be saved to any branch. If you want to keep changes or work on this state, you’ll need to create a new branch from here.
