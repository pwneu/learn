## Introduction to Linux

Linux is a powerful and flexible open-source operating system widely used in servers, desktops, embedded systems, and more. Understanding Linux fundamentals is crucial for anyone working in IT, cybersecurity, or software development.

## Why Learn Linux?

- **Open Source:** Linux is free and open-source, allowing users to modify and distribute the software.
- **Security:** Linux is known for its strong security model, making it a preferred choice for servers and critical systems.
- **Stability:** Linux systems are highly stable and can run for long periods without needing a reboot.
- **Community Support:** A large, active community provides extensive documentation, forums, and tools.

## Basic Linux Commands

### Navigating the File System

- `ls`: Lists files and directories in the current directory.
- `cd`: Changes the current directory.
- `pwd`: Prints the current working directory.

Example:

- Navigates to the home directory using `~`.
```bash
cd ~ 
```
- This shows what directory you are currently on.
```bash
pwd 
```
- List all files in the current directory including hidden files.
```bash
ls -la 
```

### Managing Files and Directories

- `touch`: Creates a file
- `cp`: Copies files or directories.
- `mv`: Moves or renames files or directories.
- `rm`: Removes files or directories.
- `mkdir`: Creates a new directory.

Example: 

- Creates a file named `file.txt`.
```bash
touch file.txt
```

- Creates a copy of `file.txt` named `copiedFile.txt` in the current directory using `.`.
```bash
cp file.txt copiedFile.txt
```

:::info
You can autocomplete the name of the existing file or a directory by pressing the `Tab` key.
:::

- Renames `copiedFile.txt` to `renamedFile.txt`.
```bash
mv copiedFile.txt renamedFile.txt 
```

- Deletes a file.
```bash
rm renamedFile.txt 
```

- Another way of deleting a file but it's not advisable.
```bash
mv file.txt /dev/null
```

- Creates a directory named `new_directory`.
```bash
mkdir new_directory
```

- Removes a directory named `new_directory` by specifying `-r` meaning recursive.
```bash
rm -r new_directory
```

### Viewing and Editing Files

- `cat`: Displays the contents of a file.
- `less`: Views the contents of a file page by page.
- `nano`: Opens a file in the `Nano` text editor.
- `vim`: Opens a file in the `Vim` text editor.

Example:

- Shows the content of a file.
```bash
cat file.txt 
```

- Similar to `cat` but with scrolling when the content is large.
```bash
less file.txt 
```

- Edits a file using `Nano`.
```bash
nano file.txt 
```

- Edits a file using `Vim`.
```bash
vim file.txt
```

:::info Exiting Vim
If you're stuck in Vim. You can exit without saving changes by pressing `Esc` 3 times (or more) and typing `:q!` and `Enter`.
:::

### User and Permission Management

- `sudo`: Executes a command as the superuser or another user.
- `chmod`: Changes file or directory permissions.
- `chown`: Changes the owner of a file or directory.
- `passwd`: Changes the user password.

Example:

- Similar to checking for updates in Windows.
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

- Updates all your packages.
```bash
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

## Checking Network Configuration

- Installs network-related commands.
```bash
sudo apt install net-tools
```
- Displays network interfaces and their configurations.
```bash
ifconfig
```

- Displays network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics.
```bash
netstat
```

Tests connectivity to another host.
```bash
ping google.com
```

:::info Cancelling commands
You can cancel commands by pressing `Ctrl + C`. In most linux terminals, you copy text using the `Ctrl + Shift + C` command.
