## Introduction

`grep` (Global Regular Expression Print) is a powerful command-line utility used for searching text using patterns. It is commonly used in Unix-based systems like Linux and macOS to search for specific strings or patterns within files.

## Practice file
You can download this file to practice `grep`.

```bash
wget -O sample.txt https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Donders-Institute/hpc-wiki-v2/master/docs/linux/exercise/gcutError_recon-all.log
```

## Basic Usage

- To search for a specific text within a file:
```bash
grep "used" sample.txt
```

- To perform a case-insensitive search:
```bash
grep -i "home" sample.txt
```

:::info
My apologies for the large output. Type `clear` in the terminal to remove all your output.
:::

- To search for whole words only:
```bash
grep -w "Program" sample.txt
```

- To display line numbers along with matching lines:
```bash
grep -n "used" sample.txt
```

## Advanced Usage

### Basic Regular Expressions

- `.`: Matches any single character.
- `*`: Matches zero or more of the preceding character.

Example:

```bash
grep "a.b" sample.txt
```

### Extended Regular Expressions

Use `-E` to enable extended regular expressions:

- `|`: Alternation (OR).
- `+`: Matches one or more of the preceding character.
- `?`: Matches zero or one of the preceding character.

Example:

- Search for `cat` or `dog`
```bash
grep -E "cat|dog" sample.txt
```

- To search for multiple patterns:
```bash
grep -e "max" -e "limited" sample.txt
```

### Searching Recursively

- To search recursively through directories:
```bash
grep -r "home" /etc/defaults
```

### Inverting Match

- To display lines that do not match the pattern:
```bash
grep -v "hi" sample.txt
```

## Cleanup

- You can now remove the sample file once you're done:
```bash
rm sample.txt
```
