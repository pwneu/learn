The challenges distributed across the identified
categories: general skills, programming, steganography, cryptography, OSINT,
forensics, and web exploitation. These challenges are designed for a variety of skills
across different difficulty levels to cater to both beginner and advance.

These challenges are intentionally devoid of explicit guidance to provide students
with the opportunity to exercise critical thinking and problem-solving skills in unfamiliar
and complex scenarios. By navigating these challenges, students are encouraged to
rely on their own creativity, judgment, and technical abilities. This method fosters
resilience, adaptability, and the confidence to approach new situations with an open
mind and a strategic perspective.

Below are detailed descriptions of the various challenge categories and their
corresponding Capture-The-Flag (CTF) challenges:

### Miscellaneous 
This category includes challenges that do not fit
neatly into other categories. They cover a wide range of topics and require
students to use a diverse set of skills to solve unique problems.

### General Skill 
Challenges in this category focus on foundational
skills necessary for cybersecurity. These may include tasks related to basic
scripting, command line usage, or fundamental security concepts.

### Steganography
Steganography challenges involve hiding
information within various media types. Students must discover and extract
hidden messages from images, audio files, or other formats.

### Cryptography 
This category includes challenges related to the
encryption and decryption of data. Students must apply their knowledge of
cryptographic algorithms and techniques to decode or secure information.

### OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) 
OSINT challenges require
students to gather and analyze publicly available information from various
sources. These tasks help students develop skills in information gathering
and data analysis using open-source tools.

### Forensics 
Digital forensics challenges focus on investigating and
analyzing digital artifacts. Students must uncover evidence, trace activities,
and understand the digital footprint left by users or attackers.

### Programming 
Programming challenges test students' coding
skills and their ability to write scripts or programs to solve specific problems.
These challenges often require a deep understanding of programming
languages and logic.

### Web Exploitation 
Web challenges involve identifying and
exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications. Students must understand web
technologies and common security flaws to successfully complete these
tasks.
