The CTF Challenges for RA 10175 Compliance follow a structured framework to
ensure alignment with Republic Act No. 10175 (Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012) and
cybersecurity best practices.

The process begins with the Cybercrime Offense
Evaluation, which categorizes offenses into three main areas: data and system attacks,
computer-related crimes, and content violations.

Following this evaluation, the CTF Challenge Structuring phase develops
cybersecurity exercises to address these offenses. This includes ethical hacking
scenarios, simulated cybersecurity attacks and defenses, and problem-solving
exercises designed to enhance cybersecurity skills. Once structured, the challenges
undergo Compliance Verification, where they are assessed for alignment with RA
10175, adherence to cybersecurity standards, and compliance with legal and ethical
guidelines.

At this stage, a decision is made: if the challenges do not meet compliance
requirements, they are sent for redesign and reassessment. If they pass, they proceed
to Testing, where security audits are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the
challenges. If the challenges are found ineffective, they undergo modification and
retesting. If successful, the process concludes with a Finalized CTF Challenge, ensuring
full compliance with RA 10175, legal and ethical soundness, and effectiveness in
cybersecurity education and preparedness.
