## Introduction to CyberChef

CyberChef is a web-based tool designed for cyber operations and data analysis. It provides a graphical interface for performing a variety of data manipulation tasks, making it particularly useful for cybersecurity professionals, digital forensics experts, and data analysts.

## Features

- **Data Transformation**: Convert and transform data between different formats such as hexadecimal, base64, and binary. CyberChef can handle complex encodings and decodings with ease.

- **Encryption and Decryption**: Supports a wide range of cryptographic algorithms, including AES, RSA, and hashing functions like SHA-256. You can encrypt and decrypt data directly within the tool.

- **Data Analysis**: Perform operations such as data extraction, pattern recognition, and statistical analysis. CyberChef provides a suite of built-in operations to analyze and manipulate data.

- **Recipe Automation**: Create and save “recipes” that define a sequence of operations to apply to data. This feature allows for repetitive tasks to be automated and shared with others.

- **Extensive Library of Operations**: Includes operations for encoding/decoding, compression, encryption, data conversion, and more. The library is continually updated with new features and capabilities.

## Using CyberChef

To get started with CyberChef:

1. **Accessing CyberChef:**
   CyberChef is available online at [CyberChef's official website](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/). It can also be run locally by downloading and hosting it on your own server.

2. **Basic Operations:**

   - **Enter Data:** Input data into the input field or load data from a file.
   - **Apply Operations:** Select operations from the left-hand panel and configure them as needed. Drag and drop operations to build your recipe.
   - **View Results:** Results are displayed in the output field. You can copy the results or download them as needed.

3. **Creating Recipes:**

   - Click on the "Save" button to store your current operations as a recipe.
   - Share recipes by exporting them as JSON files or using the shareable URL feature.

4. **Advanced Features:**
   - **Scripting:** CyberChef supports custom JavaScript code to extend functionality.
   - **Regular Expressions:** Utilize regular expressions to perform complex data extraction and manipulation tasks.

## Using CyberChef Offline

If you want to run CyberChef offline, you can use **Docker**:

```bash
docker pull gchq/cyberchef
docker run -d -p 8080:80 gchq/cyberchef
```

If you don't know how to use **Docker**, the official website works fine.

## Examples

### Encoding and Decoding Base64

To encode data in Base64:

1. Enter your data into the input field.
2. Select the "To Base64" operation from the list.
3. View the Base64 encoded result.

To decode Base64 data:

1. Enter Base64 data into the input field.
2. Select the "From Base64" operation from the list.
3. View the decoded result.

### Encryption and Decryption

To encrypt data with AES:

1. Enter your plaintext into the input field.
2. Select the "AES Encrypt" operation.
3. Configure the encryption key and parameters.
4. View the encrypted result.

To decrypt AES-encrypted data:

1. Enter the encrypted data into the input field.
2. Select the "AES Decrypt" operation.
3. Provide the encryption key and parameters.
4. View the decrypted result.
