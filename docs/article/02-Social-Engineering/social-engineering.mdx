In this article, you will learn about social engineering. It is one of the most powerful techniques in a hacker’s arsenal and one of the hardest to defend against.

### What We’ll Be Learning
Security is only as strong as its weakest link, and sometimes that link is us!

Social Engineering is a technique that targets the human factor in a system often by avoiding its technical security measures.

In this article, you will learn what social engineering is and the principles it uses to manipulate people.

## Social Engineering 101
#### What Exactly is Social Engineering?
Social engineering is the art of “hacking the human.” If a strong password secures a system, it is a lot faster to trick someone into giving you the password than using a password cracker. It is easy to make fun of the idea of being tricked into revealing your password. However, this sort of mocking is why social engineering is so effective. Social engineering takes advantage of the cognitive biases and social norms that we grew up with and uses those biases and norms to manipulate us.

### Why Does Social Engineering Work?
Just as computers can be manipulated to do things, so can humans. Imagine you are a receptionist in an office building. Only authorized personnel are allowed into the building. You get a call from an elevator maintenance company letting you know that they are sending a technician to investigate the elevators. Your boss did not mention anything to you about this information. What would you do?

In this scenario, it turns out that social engineering is occurring. The supposedly ‘elevator maintenance company’ and ‘technician’ are social engineers trying to obtain access into the building. They want to avoid its technical security measures (i.e., verifying their identity to the receptionist). Identifying the manipulation in this scenario can be difficult for some. As a result, most people would let the ‘technician’ in.

Humans are social creatures which makes social engineering so effective. It uses a combination of authority, intimidation, consensus, scarcity, familiarity, trust, and urgency to take advantage of people’s social norms. There are examples of penetration testers wearing high-visible vests and tool belts before drilling into a server room in broad daylight, with no questions asked.

### The Principles of Social Engineering
Like hacking, social engineering has core principles applied in various ways to manipulate a target. While the core principles in hacking exploit the design of our technologies, the principles used in social engineering exploit our cognitive biases and social norms.

### Principle 1: Consensus
Consensus, also known as Social Proof, is when a social engineer convinces victims that others have already trusted them. There are many ways to apply consensus to social engineering. Some examples are fake website reviews on social media, forged work orders, using deep fake technology to impersonate someone over the phone in real-time.

### Principle 2: Familiarity
Familiarity, also known as Trust, refers to a social engineer using charisma and likeability to get a victim to complete a request. Familiarity is often as simple as striking up a friendly conversation with a victim before making a request. It is often even more effective if the social engineer is, or appears to be, part of the victim’s “in-group.” For example, striking up a conversation with a security guard about the struggles of the night shift or manipulating an inexperienced receptionist by pretending it is your first day and you forgot your badge.

### Principle 3: Urgency
Urgency, also known as Scarcity, refers to a social engineer creating a sense of hurry to put time pressure on a victim. Creating a sense of urgency discourages the victim from thinking critically about the request while also making them feel like they are helping someone in need. Urgency is a time-honored tradition among scammers. One example is emails and robocalls informing you that your warranty is about to expire unless you ACT NOW!

### Principle 4: Authority
Authority, or Intimidation, is a high-risk strategy in which a social engineer attempts to intimidate a victim or claim authority over them. While usually more subtle than “Don’t you know who I am,” Intimidation is not a subtle strategy. It has an elevated risk of the victim reporting the incident rather than complying. More practically, Authority can be combined with Consensus to create the illusion that not only is the social engineer already trusted but that they are trusted by someone with authority over the victim.

## Conclusion
Social Engineering is a very effective tool used by ethical and malicious hackers alike. While strong technological security is important, ignoring the human aspect of security creates a severe vulnerability that threat actors can easily exploit. Protecting against social engineering is more than annual training; it requires creating a security culture where people understand their importance and the threats they may face.
