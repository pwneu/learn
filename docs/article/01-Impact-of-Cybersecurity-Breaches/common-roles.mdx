Cybersecurity **Incident Response**, or IR, consists of the activities and response procedures from the moment a data breach is suspected all through the post-incident response closure.

Incident responders typically work as part of a team within an organization to handle all aspects of major cybersecurity incidents. According to NIST, effective incident response involves the following steps:

- Preparation
- Detection and Analysis
- Containment
- Eradication and Recovery
- Post-Incident Activities

Some examples of major cybersecurity incidents that IR professionals will be called upon to handle include, but are not limited to:

- data exfiltration
- ransomware
- distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks
- malicious code.
