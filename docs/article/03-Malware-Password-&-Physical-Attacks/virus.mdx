You navigate to your client’s email. Immediately, you see that your client opened some emails sent from an odd email address. You open the emails and see that the client clicked on links and likely downloaded files from these suspicious emails. Uh oh. Did your client download a virus?

A virus is a malicious self-replacing application that attaches itself to other programs and executables without the permission of the user. It’s possible a downloaded virus could alter or delete data on the computer.

If the virus was able to access or alter data, the confidentiality and integrity of that data is now in question.

### Your Suggestion
- Just like with adware, avoid suspicious links and install trustworthy antivirus software.
- Immediately report suspicious emails to your IT department and never open them.
