As you navigate the web, you notice lots of ads popping up all over the place. There are so many popping up on your screen that it’s actually slowing down the webpage and increasing page load times.

It’s clear this computer has adware. **Adware** is unwanted software designed to throw advertisements on your screen. While not overly malicious on the surface, sometimes adware can come bundled with other, more harmful malware.

With enough adware on your machine, this could become a real performance issue.

### Your Suggestion
- You tell your client to make sure to not click on any strange links or download any untrustworthy files.
- A trustworthy antivirus software could also help with this issue.
