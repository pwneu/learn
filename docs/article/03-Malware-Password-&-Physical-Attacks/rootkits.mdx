Scanning the device, you find that this horrible device just keeps getting worse; the Trojan horse was used to sneak a rootkit onto the system.

Rootkits are a collection of malicious programs that secretly provide continued, privileged access to a system for an unauthorized user. A rootkit can create a backdoor on a computer to let a hacker in. This rootkit was able to gain admin access to this computer, and it will be incredibly hard to remove.

In this case, the Trojan Horse pretended to be a trustworthy antivirus software in order to install a rootkit. This means that a malicious, third-party somewhere has admin access to this computer and its data. This is a nightmare scenario for the confidentiality and integrity of your client’s system. While some specialized tools can remove a rootkit, it isn’t easy.
