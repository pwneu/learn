Spyware is malicious code downloaded without a user’s authorization which is used to steal sensitive information and relay it to an outside party in a way that harms the original user. If the spyware contained a keylogger, a program that can record what a victim types into their computer, a threat actor could potentially gain access to sensitive information.

This means any sensitive data, like passwords, will soon be in the hands of a malicious third-party. While spyware usually isn’t used to alter data, it definitely violates the principle of confidentiality. A malicious actor may have been spying on sensitive data your client was typing.
