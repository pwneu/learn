## Introduction to SQLmap

SQLmap is an open-source penetration testing tool designed to automate the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. It is widely used by security professionals and researchers for its comprehensive feature set and ease of use.

:::danger
SQLmap should **only** be used on systems you have permission to test. Unauthorized testing of websites or databases is illegal and can result in severe consequences, including legal action. Always ensure that you have explicit consent before performing any security testing.
:::

## Key Features

- **Automated SQL Injection Detection:** SQLmap can automatically identify and exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications by sending a variety of payloads and analyzing responses.

- **Database Fingerprinting:** Identifies the type and version of the underlying database management system (DBMS) to tailor the injection techniques accordingly.

- **Support for Multiple Databases:** Supports a wide range of databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite.

- **Data Extraction:** Capable of extracting data from the database, including table names, column names, and actual data records.

- **Advanced Techniques:** Implements advanced techniques such as time-based blind SQL injection, error-based SQL injection, and out-of-band SQL injection.

- **Customizable Payloads:** Allows users to specify custom payloads and use various techniques to bypass security measures and evade detection.

## Installation

Here's how to install **SQLmap**:

:::info
Pre-installed with Kali Linux.
:::

#### Linux with Python and Git
```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap.git sqlmap-dev
```

## Basic Usage

To perform a basic SQL injection test on a URL, use the following command:

:::info
On Kali Linux, you don't need to type `python sqlmap.py` in the command line. The command has been aliased to `sqlmap`
:::

```bash
python sqlmap.py -u "http://example.com/page.php?id=1" --dbs
```

- `-u` specifies the target URL.
- `--dbs` lists the databases available on the target server.

## Advanced Usage

### Testing Multiple Parameters

To test multiple parameters for SQL injection:

python sqlmap.py -u "http://example.com/page.php?id=1&name=test" --batch

### Extracting Data

To extract data from a specific database:

```bash
python sqlmap.py -u "http://example.com/page.php?id=1" -D database_name -T table_name -C column_name --dump
```

- `-D` specifies the database name.
- `-T` specifies the table name.
- `-C` specifies the column name.
- `--dump` extracts the data.

### Using Cookie-Based Authentication

To test a site that requires authentication via cookies:

```
python sqlmap.py -u "http://example.com/page.php?id=1" --cookie "SESSIONID=your_session_id"
```
