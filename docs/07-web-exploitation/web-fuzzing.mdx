### Using Go

If you have **Go** installed, you can install FFUF using the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/ffuf/ffuf@latest
```

### Binary Releases

You can also download precompiled binaries from the [FFUF GitHub releases page](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf/releases).

## Basic Usage

To perform a basic directory fuzzing scan, use the following command:

```bash
ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w /path/to/wordlist.txt
```

- `-u` specifies the URL to fuzz, with `FUZZ` being the placeholder for where the payloads will be inserted.
- `-w` specifies the path to the wordlist file containing the payloads.

## Advanced Usage

### Fuzzing Multiple Parameters

To fuzz multiple parameters simultaneously:

```bash
ffuf -u http://example.com/page?param1=FUZZ1&param2=FUZZ2 -w /path/to/wordlist1.txt -w /path/to/wordlist2.txt
```

### Using Custom Headers

To include custom headers in your requests:

```bash
ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Filtering Results
To filter results based on status codes:

```bash
ffuf -u http://example.com/FUZZ -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -fc 404
```

- `-fc` specifies status codes to filter out from the results.
